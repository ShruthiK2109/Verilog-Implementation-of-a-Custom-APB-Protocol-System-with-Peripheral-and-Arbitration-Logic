This design is a simple APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) system involving multiple components: an APB Master, APB Slave, Fixed Priority Arbiter, FIFO buffer, and memory interface. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key modules:

1. APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Module
   
The APB module orchestrates communication between read/write requests and the APB protocol using arbitration, FIFO buffering, and APB master-slave interaction. It arbitrates between incoming read_i and write_i signals using a fixed-priority arbiter, giving higher priority to write operations. The arbitration result is encoded and pushed into a FIFO queue that serializes access to the shared APB bus. When the bus is free, the FIFO's command is popped and passed to the APB_MASTER, which drives the APB control signals. The APB_SLAVE responds to these signals by interacting with a memory interface. The output rd_valid_o signals a successful read, and rd_data_o provides the corresponding data.


3. FIXED_PRIORITY_ARBITRER Module
   
The FIXED_PRIORITY_ARBITRER module is a simple combinational logic-based arbiter that grants access based on a fixed priority scheme, where lower-indexed ports have higher priority. Given a vector of request signals, it generates a one-hot encoded grant signal where only the highest-priority active request is granted. In this design, it ensures deterministic arbitration between two ports (read and write), with write (write_i) taking precedence over read (read_i).


5. APB_MASTER Module
   
The APB_MASTER module acts as the controller for the APB protocol, handling the generation of psel, penable, paddr, pwrite, and pwdata signals required for bus transactions. It operates as a finite state machine (FSM) with IDLE, SETUP, and ACCESS states, adhering to the APB timing requirements. It interprets a 2-bit command (cmd_i) from the FIFO to initiate read or write operations. On a read, it stores the data in an internal register; on a write, it increments the stored data and writes it back. It interacts with the slave only when the FIFO signals a valid command.


7. APB_SLAVE Module
   
The APB_SLAVE module interfaces with the APB_MASTER, decoding the control signals to interact with a simple memory module. It monitors the APB handshake signals (psel, penable) to detect valid transactions and forwards the request to the SIMPLE_MEMORY_INTERFACE. It handles both read and write requests, supplying the data or accepting the write based on the pwrite signal, and generates the pready signal to indicate the completion of the transaction.


9. SIMPLE_MEMORY_INTERFACE Module
The SIMPLE_MEMORY_INTERFACE module acts as the backend memory system, accepting abstracted memory requests with address, data, and read/write control. When a valid request is received, it performs a memory read or write depending on the req_rnw_i signal and returns data (req_rdata_o) or an acknowledgment (req_ready_o). It provides a simplified and reusable abstraction for memory transactions in APB slave interactions.
